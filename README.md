# LoggingHandler

A study repository focused on exploring strategies to log HTTP requests and responses between .NET-based APIs. The project captures, stores, and manages logs locally and asynchronously uploads them to AWS S3 using background processing.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is composed of two main APIs:

- **IntegrationApi**: A mock API that provides generic responses.
- **MyTestingApi**: Sends HTTP requests to the IntegrationApi and generates logs for both the request and response.

These logs are first saved as local files, and then a background worker will upload them to Amazon S3. Metadata from each log is also persisted in a PostgreSQL database for search and traceability.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```graphql
â”œâ”€â”€ APIs               # ContÃ©m os projetos de API (IntegrationApi, MyTestingApi)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IntegrationApi
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MyTestingApi
â”œâ”€â”€ Infra.Shared       # ServiÃ§os externos compartilhados entre os mÃ³dulos
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HttpClients    # Clientes HTTP utilizados pelas APIs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Storage        # IntegraÃ§Ãµes com armazenamento local e S3
â”œâ”€â”€ Modules            # ServiÃ§os de domÃ­nio reutilizÃ¡veis (por exemplo, LogService)
â”œâ”€â”€ Workers            # ServiÃ§os de segundo plano (ex: envio de arquivos para o S3)
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml # OrquestraÃ§Ã£o dos serviÃ§os para execuÃ§Ã£o local
```

## ðŸ§ª Technologies

- .NET 9
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon S3 (for file storage)
- Amazon SQS (planned for event queuing)
- Localstack (for developing with AWS tecnologies)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

To spin up the environment locally using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will create three containers:

1. PostgreSQL â€“ stores metadata for log files.
2. IntegrationApi â€“ provides mock responses.
3. MyTestingApi â€“ makes HTTP requests and generates logs.
4. (planned) Worker - brackground service to send logs to s3
5. (planned) Localstack - simulate aws services

Future components like the Log Upload Worker, SQS queue, and S3 integration will be added later (marked as planned in the list above).

## Documentation

The documentation from the APIs can be found in the open api json (considering the docker-compose):

- IntegrationApi
```bash
http://localhost:5002/openapi/v1/openapi.json
```
- MyTestingApi
```bash
http://localhost:5000/openapi/v1/openapi.json
```

---

## ðŸ“‚ Log Flow

1. MyTestingApi sends an HTTP request to IntegrationApi.
2. The request and response are intercepted and saved as a local log file.
3. (in development) An event is triggered for background processing (upload).
3. (in development) A Worker will consume the message, upload the log file to S3, and persist metadata in PostgreSQL.

## ðŸ“¦ Module Highlights

- HttpClients: Generic HTTP clients used for inter-API communication.
- VolumeFileStorage: Handles local file operations for logs.
- S3FileStorage (in development): Responsible for uploading logs to AWS S3.
- LogUploadWorker (in development): Background service to consume SQS and manage file uploads.
